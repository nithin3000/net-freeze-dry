S210_nRF51422_3.0.0

This release consists of the following:
- This readme file
- The S210_nRF51422_3.0.0 softdevice (binary hex file)
- The S210_nRF51422_3.0.0 API (softdevice header files)
- The S210_nRF51422_3.0.0 licence text
- The S210_nRF51422_3.0.0 release notes


IMPORTANT NOTE: If you intend to use the softdevice with the nRF51
